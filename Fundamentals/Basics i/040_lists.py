# lists are a form of an array, a collection of items

# What is a data structure?

# a way to organize data
# for example, fridge to hold food
# or a backpack to store a laptop/books

# the [], allow us to store data in a contained fashion

amazon_cart = ['notebooks', 'sunglasses']
print(amazon_cart[3]) #=> list index out of range

# these list items are in memory in a bookshelf
