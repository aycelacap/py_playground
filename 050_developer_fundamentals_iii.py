# quiet when im coming home
# understanding data structures

# a good programmer is able to understand which data structure to use and when
# when to use what

# When should you use a list and when should you use a dictionary?

# a list has order
# a dictionary has an order

# dictionaries hold more information that lists
# we have a dictionary inside of a list 
# key, value -> more information
