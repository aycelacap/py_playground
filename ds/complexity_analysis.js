// Complexity analysis helps you understand data structures more

// some solutions are better than others
// can you find a better solution?
// what makes one solution better than another?
// ... whether or not a problem has better complexity 

// complexity can be divided into two 
// space and time complexity

// Space Complexity - measure of space
// Time complexity - measure of time it takes to solve an algorithm

// better solutions would be having fast time complexity and better space complexity
// different data structures have different ramifications for time/space complexity

// be familiar with ramifications of space/time complexity
// how fast it runs and space it takes up
