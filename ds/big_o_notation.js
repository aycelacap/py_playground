// time complexity -> how much time it takes for it to be solved
// space complexoty -> how much auxilliary memory an algoorithm takes

// time complexity depends on the size of the input 
// we care about how the run time changes as the size of the input increases

// Constant O(1)-> as size of the input(n) increases, the speed of n is constant

// Linearly O(N) -> as input increases, the speed of the algorithm increases linearly
// were gonna do as many iterations as there is n

// Polynomial function -> n iterations for every n -> O(N^2) 

// Asymptotic Analysis -> study the behaviour of a function as n approaches infinity

// /////// constant ///////////
// we dont care about elementary constants, have a fixed amount of fillling in mempry slots
// we only care about significant operations/factors in our complexity

// what is the Big-O notation of O(N^2 + N + 1)?
// as n approaches infinity, N and 1 become insignificant, so O(n^2) 
// is the big-O notation for O(N^2 + N + 1)

// O(N) 
// O(log(n))
// O(N)
// O(N^2)
