// time complexity -> how much time it takes for it to be solved
// space complexoty -> how much memory 

// time complexity depends on the size of the input 
// we care about how the run time changes as the size of the input increases

// Constant O(1)-> as sixe of the imput increases, the speed of n is constant

//Linearly
