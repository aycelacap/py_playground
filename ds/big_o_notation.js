// time complexity -> how much time it takes for it to be solved
// space complexoty -> how much auxilliary memory an algoorithm takes

// time complexity depends on the size of the input 
// we care about how the run time changes as the size of the input increases

// Constant O(1)-> as size of the input(n) increases, the speed of n is constant

// Linearly O(N) -> as input increases, the speed of the algorithm increases linearly
// were gonna do as many iterations as there is n

// Pairing function -> n iterations for every n -> O(N^2) 

// Asymptotic Analysis -> study the behaviour of a function as n approaches infinity

// /////// constant ///////////
// we dont care about elementary constants
