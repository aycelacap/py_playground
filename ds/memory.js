// one more layer of foundational knowledge - memory

// memory -> from the context of coding, purely relevent for coding interviews

// imagine a grid canvas of slots, memory slots
// how is memory measured? it's measured in bits
// 1 memory slot can hold 8 bits = 1 byte

// we can transform the integer 1 into a bit, using the binary system
// look up base 2 system, lookup binary number article on Wikipedia, also endianess (ordering of bites)
// most significant byte is to the left
// they key thing to remember is 32 bit integer will deal with 4 memory slots (4 bytes)
// 64 bits -> 8 memory slots always constant number of memory slot 
// when dealing with memory slots for integers, it is fixed height and width

// 1 as an integer is saved in 4 back to back memory slots

// what if we wanted to store [1, 2] as a list
// we storing 2 32 bit integers so we need 8 memory slots

// if a memory address is filled up an random slots but we need back to back memory slots, we'll have stored
// the data in where memory slots are available 

// ascii of "A" is 65 
// ascii is a standardized table of keys and their respective values
// every character of a string is mapped to a number
// slots have memory addresses (they are in binary)

// memory slots can point to different memory slots (pointers)

// computer can access memory slots given a memory address very quickly, inexpensive operation
// this is an operation that doesnt take much time

// IMPORTANT
